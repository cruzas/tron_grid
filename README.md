Tron Kart
=========

This repository holds the work of 4 contributors with the aim to develop a game inspired by the classic Tron game and Mario Kart.

How to run the program?
-


Just execute the **run.py** script using Python 3.4 (other versions of Python 3 should work as well). 

You can run `run.py` from the `IDLE` or from the terminal. If you want to run it from the terminal, you should first change the file permissions with the following command to make the script executable:

    chmod +x run.py
    
Then you can simply run it using the following command:

    ./run.py
